A special thanks to the SCST (scst.sourceforge.net) project & development
team -- ESOS is built around SCST, and we really owe everything to them.

This article was very helpful in designing ESOS, specifically with the
init setup (BSD style).

Lots of information/ideas came from this document when creating the 'image'
Makefile recipe and the disk imaging process.
