- Add support for Emulex FC HBAs; waiting on Emulex for updated lpfc to SCST shim (lpfc_scst) to work with newer kernels.
- Speed up the ESOS build process. Possibly use the GNU make '--jobs' option to help.
- Rework the conf_sync.sh script so its a bit more flexible; possibly sync. all of /etc and /var or something similar.
- We use the device identification VPD page from devices for unique identifiers, but not all devices support this.
- Newer Linux kernel releases no longer have updated firmware blobs; the driver references a version that does not exist in firmware/ and the user is expected to use the linux-firmware package for these referenced versions. This will need to be addressed in the next ESOS kernel version bump as some driver's firmware blobs are not compatible with the GPL, which means we probably can't re-distribute a binary ESOS image with these drivers. We will likely need to be more selective on what hardware/drivers can be used.
