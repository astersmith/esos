- Add support for Emulex FC HBAs; waiting on Emulex for updated lpfc to SCST shim (lpfc_scst) to work with newer kernels.
- Compiling gcc takes forever! All we need is libgcc and libstdc++ -- any ideas?
- Implement TUI functions for DRBD, LVM2, and creating/mounting filesystems for vdisk_fileio.
- Add support for high-availability, possibly via Linux-HA project.
