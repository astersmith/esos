- Add support for Emulex FC HBAs; waiting on Emulex for updated lpfc to SCST shim (lpfc_scst) to work with newer kernels.
- Speed up the ESOS build process. Possibly use the GNU make '--jobs' option to help.
- Rework the conf_sync.sh script so its a bit more flexible; possibly sync. all of /etc and /var or something similar.
- We use the device identification VPD page from devices for unique identifiers, but not all devices support this.
