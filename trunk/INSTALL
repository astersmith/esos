The ESOS project is really just a Makefile, scripts, config. files, and
hopefully someday will have a very nice text user interface for management.
The Makefile fetches all required distribution files, or for restricted
packages, it provides directions on obtaining those files. It then extracts
and compiles everything. The 'install' target prompts for a USB flash drive
device node and then installs ESOS on it.

In order to build ESOS, you need a recent release of a modern Linux
distribution that has the software development packages installed. Please
visit the ESOS project home page for all of the prerequisites and detailed
build/install instructions: http://code.google.com/p/enterprise-storage-os/

If this source is coming from svn/trunk then you will need to generate the
configure script, otherwise if this is a release, it should already be present.

The following should work in most cases:
autoconf
./configure
make
sudo make install

If you're still having trouble building ESOS, even after reading the detailed
documentation on the project home page, please use the Google Group for
support: http://groups.google.com/group/esos-users
