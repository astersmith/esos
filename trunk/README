ESOS (Enterprise Storage OS) is a Linux distribution of sorts that provides
block-level storage targets. Its based on the Linux kernel and the SCST
project. It also provides all of the necessary utilities/tools to configure
your back-storage devices (eg, RAID controllers). A text user interface (TUI) is
also included for storage provisioning and system management tasks.

Currently ESOS is very, very new and probably shouldn't be used as a
production disk array. That being said, the two core components of ESOS,
the Linux Kernel and SCST, are both quite stable.

The project home is located here: http://code.google.com/p/enterprise-storage-os/

installation, etc. The included INSTALL document provides brief build/install
instructions.
