ESOS (Enterprise Storage OS) is a sort of Linux distribution that provides
block-level storage targets. Its based on the Linux kernel and the SCST
project. It also provides all of the necessary utilities/tools to configure
your back-storage devices (eg, RAID controllers).

Currently ESOS is very, very new and probably shouldn't be used as a
production service. That being said, the two core components of ESOS,
the Linux Kernel and SCST are quite stable.

The project home is located here: http://code.google.com/p/enterprise-storage-os/

Please visit the above URL for more documentation on ESOS, including usage,
installation, etc. The included INSTALL document provides brief installation
instructions.
