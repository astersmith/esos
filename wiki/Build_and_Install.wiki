#summary How to build/install ESOS on your USB flash drive.

==== Build Prerequisites ====
Since ESOS makes use of some proprietary software, currently the only method of getting/installing it is to grab the source and compile it on your computer. ESOS is still in the very early stages of development/testing so the only method of obtaining the source is via SVN; there are no "release" tarballs available yet.

Here is a list of the build host system requirements:
  * A recent release, of a modern x86-64 Linux distribution (64-bit Linux is required since ESOS uses only 64-bit kernel/programs).
  * All of the typical software development packages (eg, GCC, GNU Make, Autoconf, Libtool, etc.) are required.
  * A USB flash drive that is at least 4 GB -- not really required for building, but need to install the ESOS "distribution" on to (below).
  * Subversion is required to pull the source down to your machine.
  * The configure script will check for all of the required tools/utilities that are used directly by the ESOS Makefile.
  * Other tools, libraries, etc. that are required by the packages/projects that ESOS uses should be caught by those project's configure scripts.
  * Some free disk space for building, probably around 10 GB to be safe.
  * A lot of time! Unfortunately, several larger projects (GCC, Linux kernel, glibc, etc.) are required that take quite a while to compile.

Using _Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Server x86_64_ as your build host:
  * Standard install, defaults for everything.
  * blah

Using _SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 x86_64_ as your build host:
  * blah
  * blah

==== Building ESOS ====
Grab the latest revision from trunk:
{{{
svn checkout http://enterprise-storage-os.googlecode.com/svn/trunk esos
cd esos
}}}

Generate the configure script and execute it:
{{{
autoconf
./configure
}}}

Finally, run make, which will fetch, extract, and build everything:
{{{
make
}}}
