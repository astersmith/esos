#summary Configuring your back-storage: RAID volumes, file systems, virtual disk files, etc.

=== Getting Started ===
There are two broad steps when provisioning storage with ESOS: The first is configuring your back-end storage device which is typically a high-end RAID controller, or virtual disk files on file systems, or can be anything else that appears as a SCSI block device in Linux. Enterprise Storage OS includes a number of different Linux block device subsystems such as DRBD, Linux software RAID (md), and LVM2 so the possibilities are quite endless.

The second step is configuring your front side target devices, the targets that are made available via your SAN. _This will be covered in the subsequent ESOS wiki pages (devices, targets, and hosts/initiators)._

=== RAID Controller TUI Functions ===
ESOS has limited support for provisioning/configuring logical drives via the TUI. Currently only LSI Logic MegaRAID adapters are supported using the TUI logical drive / adapter functions. Using these functions requires the MegaCLI tool which is an option during the USB flash drive installation. Advanced adapter properties, multi-span logical drives, etc. are not supported.

A few basic RAID controller/adapter properties are configurable via the TUI: Back-End Storage -> Adapter Properties

Using the adapter information dialog (Back-End Storage -> Adapter Information) will allow you select a RAID controller and will display an overview of the attached storage (enclosures + devices).

To add a new logical drive (Back-End Storage -> Add Volume) you will first select the desired RAID adapter; next you will be presented with screen that contains the available disks. Select the disks and hit ENTER (or ESCAPE to cancel). On the final dialog, you will choose the RAID level, strip size, cache options, etc. and then hit 'OK' to proceed with provisioning the volume or 'Cancel' to do nothing and close the dialog.

Deleting volumes / logical drives (Back-End Storage -> Delete Volume) and modifying volume properties (Back-End Storage -> Volume Properties) is also possible via the TUI.

After you have configured your RAID logical drive(s), you can now proceed to the advanced back-end storage document, or below for creating a file system on the new device and adding virtual disks, or move on to adding your SCST device(s).
