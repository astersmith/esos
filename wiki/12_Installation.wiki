#summary How to install ESOS to a USB flash drive.

=== Install Prerequisites ===
We currently only support installing/creating a ESOS USB drive by using a Linux system. The possibility exists to someday create a Windows/Mac/etc. installer, but for right now, its Linux only.

Here is a list of the install requirements:
  * Machine with a recent release of a modern Linux distribution (32-bit or 64-bit), with common system tools (dd, cpio, rpm2cpio, etc.) installed.
  * A USB flash drive that is at least 4 GB large.
  * The ESOS image/install package available from the downloads page, or a ESOS disk image that you built from source.

=== Installing ESOS ===
If using a pre-built image package, you will need to extract it (version 0.1-r412 in our example):
{{{
tar xvfJ esos-0.1-r412.tar.xz
}}}

If using a ESOS image you built from source, you should now be in that directory, otherwise change to the package directory you just extracted:
{{{
cd esos-0.1-r412
}}}

At this point, you should now plug in the USB flash drive you'd like to install ESOS to; you may need to unmount any filesystems on your flash drive if you use a desktop-like Linux distribution (eg, Ubuntu).

The `lsscsi` tool makes it very easy to find your USB drive SCSI device node (needed during the install). Here is an example of what that looks like:
{{{
[root@localhost ~]# lsscsi 
[0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      ST9160412AS      D005  /dev/sda 
[1:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  TSSTcorp DVD+-RW TS-L633C DW50  /dev/sr0 
[8:0:0:0]    disk    Kingston DataTraveler G3  1.00  /dev/sdb 
}}}

In the example above, we clearly recognize "Kingston DataTraveler G3" (hopefully) as our USB flash drive, and we can see the device node is "/dev/sdb" (far right column).

You can now run the installer script (root privileges required):
{{{
sudo ./install.sh
}}}

The `install.sh` script will verify the integrity of the ESOS disk image file, check for the required install tools, prompt for the desired SCSI device node to install ESOS on, and finally write the image to disk.

After the image is completely written to your USB flash drive, then installation script will then ask you if you'd like to install any proprietary RAID controller CLI tools (optional). Some of these tools (eg, MegaCLI) are required for certain TUI functions in ESOS. The script will print the required files and download locations with instructions on where to place the files and complete the installation.

If you have any installation issues, please use the esos-users Google Group.

=== Next Steps ===
Once you have successfully installed the ESOS image to a USB flash device, take the flash drive and plug it into your storage server. Then reboot the storage server and set USB devices to first (only) in the boot order. Then proceed to the [21_Initial_System_Configuration] page.
