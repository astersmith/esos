#summary Creating host groups and adding initiators.

=== Host/Security Group Concept ===
The terms "security group", "host group", and "initiator group" are synonymous -- they are used interchangeably, likely throughout all of the ESOS documentation. Most enterprise-grade disk arrays have a similar concept. They provide initiator-orientated access control (eg, LUN masking). Each group is unique to a SCST target.

These groups can also be used to control I/O grouping in SCST. See the SCST documentation for more information. These "advanced" I/O group type settings can be configured via the CLI.

The idea is simple: For each target, you create a host group and then add your initiators and LUNs (mapped devices). The initiators and devices can then "see each other" (devices->LUNs).

Here is a typical example used in a VMware vSphere environment: (1) ESOS storage server with (2) Fibre Channel HBAs, each FC HBA is connected to an independent Fibre Channel switch (fabric); (3) ESXi hosts with (2) FC HBAs (initiators) each, one to each FC switch; you could then create (2) SCST host/security groups in ESOS, one for each target; then for each host group, you would be adding (3) initiators (the initiators connected to that target's fabric); finally you would map each SCST device to both groups.

=== Next Steps ===
Now that you have created your SCST security group(s) and added the initiator(s), you can move on to creating your SCST device and mapping the device as a LUN to one of these host groups. Go to the [51_Device_Configuration] page.
