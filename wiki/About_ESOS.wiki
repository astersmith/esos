#summary More details on the design and internal workings.

=== Introduction ===
ESOS started with an internal need for a fully functioning SCST / Linux system that could easily be deployed to new servers. We also wanted to this Linux "distribution" to be fully optimized for SCST and include necessary RAID controller tools/utilities so new volumes could easily be provisioned/modified from inside the OS.

=== Included Projects ===
ESOS uses the open source software projects list below; you can check the Makefile for the specific versions (varies by release).
  * Linux kernel
  * SCST
  * BusyBox
  * GRUB
  * SysVinit
  * GLIBC
  * vixie-cron
  * libibumad
  * libibverbs
  * srptools
  * OpenSSH
  * sSMTP
  * Perl
  * OpenSSL
  * e2fsprogs
  * zlib
  * lsscsi
  * sg3_utils
  * groff
  * ncurses
  * kexec-tools
  * GCC (only libstdc++ and libgcc are installed to image)

Several other proprietary pieces are included/installed and some are optional:
  * QLogic firmware images
  * MegaCLI (from LSI Logic)
  * Adaptec Storage Manager (only the arcconf CLI tool is used)
