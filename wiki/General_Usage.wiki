#summary Configuring your back-storage, setting up target devices, etc.

ESOS is based on the SCST project, and it really is the core of ESOS. SCST provides a number of different features and I/O modes (pass-through, FILEIO, BLOCKIO, etc.). ESOS documentation will really focus on just one of these I/O modes, BLOCKIO, since it generally works quite well with high-end storage HBAs found in enterprise environments. Please refer to the SCST documentation for more in-depth configuration, or if you'd like to use I/O modes other than BLOCKIO (it should all work on ESOS, let us know if that's not the case).

There are two broad steps when configuring ESOS storage: The first is configuring your back-storage device which is typically a high-end RAID controller, or can be anything else that appears as a SCSI block device in Linux. The second step is configuring your front side target devices, the targets that are made available via your SAN. Please see below for examples -- pick your back-storage type, and then pick your SAN (target) type.

==== Back-Storage Setup: LSI MegaRAID ====
The LSI Logic "MegaCLI" utility is included with ESOS. The utility allows you to create/delete/modify volumes (logical drives) on your MegaRAID controller. Below are a few examples of using the MegaCLI tool (MegaCli64 for us). A nice handy cheat sheet is located [http://tools.rapidsoft.de/perc/perc-cheat-sheet.html here]. Or for a very in-depth document, consult the user guide available on LSI Logic's web site.

Get adapter information for the first MegaRAID adapter (0):
{{{
MegaCli64 -AdpAllInfo -a0
}}}

A list of all the adapter's physical drives:
{{{
MegaCli64 -PDList -a0
}}}

All of the logical drives for the adapter:
{{{
MegaCli64 -LDInfo -Lall -a0
}}}

Delete logical drive 0:
{{{
MegaCli64 -CfgLdDel -L0 -a0
}}}

Create a new RAID5 logical drive, with six physical disks, adaptive read-ahead (ADRA) and write cache (WB) enabled:
{{{
MegaCli64 -CfgLDAdd -R5[:1,:2,:3,:5,:6,:7] WB ADRA -a0
}}}

Create a new RAID0 logical drive, with two physical disks, no read-ahead (NORA) and write cache disabled (WT):
{{{
MegaCli64 -CfgLDAdd -R5[:0,:1] WT NORA -a0
}}}
