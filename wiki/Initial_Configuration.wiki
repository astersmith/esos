#summary Setting up after the first boot.

==== The First Boot ====
At this point its assumed you have already inserted your USB flash drive into your storage server's USB port, set USB as the only boot device in the BIOS, and you are at the physical console and have a login prompt. If you're ESOS USB flash drive failed to boot for some reason, please let us know on the esos-users Google Group so we can help.

The first item on your agenda will be to login as root and change the root password.
  * Superuser account: root
  * Default password: esos

Next, *this is important*, you need to change the default root password:
{{{
passwd
}}}
Choose a nice hefty password, assuming this machine will be on your IP network, you don't want it to be susceptible to easy SSH brute-force attacks.
