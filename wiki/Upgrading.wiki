#summary Learn how to upgrade ESOS on your system.

==== About Upgrading ESOS ====
First, the upgrade process for ESOS is disruptive and will require a small amount of down time. The upgrade procedure goes something like this:
  * You build/install the new version of ESOS to an entirely new, fresh USB flash drive.
  * Next, you copy the configuration files from the current (old) ESOS flash drive from your ESOS storage server to the new USB device.
  * Finally you remove the old flash drive from the server, and replace it with the new flash drive and boot your storage server.

While this upgrade procedure does involve some down time, it has one important benefit: It is very easy to revert to your old ESOS version if there is some type of problem when running the new version -- simply power off the storage server, and swap USB flash drives (use the old one).

*It is highly recommended to label your ESOS USB flash drives with some details such host name, ESOS version, date, etc. to keep organized.*

Since ESOS is a sort of memory resident operating system, you can open an ESOS shell and run `conf_sync.sh` to synchronize your configuration files. Next, remove the ESOS
