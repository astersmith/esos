#summary Configuring SCST devices on your ESOS storage server.

=== SCST I/O Modes ===
ESOS is based on the SCST project, and it really is the core of ESOS. SCST provides a number of different features and I/O modes (pass-through, FILEIO, BLOCKIO, etc.). At the time of writing this document, ESOS supports (6) SCST device I/O modes.

Here is a list and description of each supported I/O mode:
  * *Pass-Through SCSI Disk (dev_disk)*: SCSI commands coming from initiators on your SAN are passed to the local SCSI disks on the ESOS storage server as is, without any modifications. One-to-many is supported in this mode in which several initiators can safely connect to a single device.
  * *Pass-Through SCSI Disk, Performance (dev_disk_perf)*: Similar to the mode described above except no data is transferred to/from the underlying SCSI device; used for measuring performance.
  * *VDISK CDROM (vcdrom)*: This handler allows for emulation of a virtual CDROM device which uses an ISO file as the back-end -- easily share an ISO image on your SAN.
  * *VDISK BLOCKIO (vdisk_blockio)*: This mode performs direct block I/O with a block device, bypassing the Linux page cache for all operations; works ideally with high-end storage HBAs and for applications that either do not need caching between the application and disk or need the large block throughput.
  * *VDISK FILEIO (vdisk_fileio)*: Use files on file systems that are on your back-end storage devices (RAID volumes, etc.) and benefits from the Linux page cache. The back-end files act as "virtual disks" which can be manipulated offline like normal files (moved, copied, etc.). Sparse files are supported, which can act as a "thin provisioned" storage volume.
  * *VDISK NULLIO (vdisk_nullio)*: The NULLIO mode is used to create virtual devices. In this mode, no real I/O is done, but success is returned to the initiators. Its intended to be used for performance measurements similar to the dev_disk_perf mode described above.

Your specific use/needs will determine the appropriate SCST I/O mode to select and you may use a combination of these for different devices; please see the SCST documentation and SCST mailing list archives for additional information and other use scenarios regarding the SCST I/O modes.
